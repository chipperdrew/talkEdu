	<h4><a id="1">My overall user rating is incorrect</a></h4>
	<p>
		The overall user rating is calculated from all posts -- even deleted posts.
		User comments have no effect on the overall user rating.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, if you have two posts with 100% rating and five votes each, 
		your user rating should be 1.0.
		However, if you had deleted a 3rd post with 0% rating and 10 votes, your overall user rating
		should be 0.5, even though your page will display two posts with 100% rating each.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you believe your user rating has been inaccurately calculated, please 
		<a href="Mailto:youtalkedu@gmail.com">email me.</a>
	</p><br/>

	<h4><a id="2">My post has disappeared</a></h4>
	<p>
		Sometimes the website gets hungry and has to eat posts to stay alive. Rest assured, your post 
		was probably very delicious...
	</p>
	<p>
		In all seriousness, your post was likely deemed to be spam by the other users of the site.
		If your post was not spam, it should reappear on the site within a few days.
		You may still access your post by going to your user page and clicking on the post.
	</p><br/>

	<h4><a id="3">I can't log in</a></h4>
	<p>There are a couple of possibilities:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The incorrect password is being entered.</li>
			<p>
				Fix: Please change your password. You may do so by clicking 
				<a href="{% url 'password_reset' %}">here</a>.
			</p>
		<li>The incorrect username is being entered.</li>
			<p>
				Fix: If you have made any posts/comments on the site, try searching for them and
				finding the username attached to them.
{% comment %} If worst comes to worst, you may try 
					<a href="Mailto:youtalkedu@gmail.com">emailing me</a>,
					but the odds are slim that I will be able to help
					(send me every piece of info you can -- email, posts voted on, last login, etc).
{% endcomment %}
			</p>
		<li>The account has been banned.</li>
			<p>
				Fix: If you are sure you are entering in the correct username and password,
				your account is likely banned. 
				If you haven't posted any ban-worthy material on the site,
				this is likely the result of someone stealing your password and posting as you. 
				Depending on my mood, I may return your account to you. 
				Press your luck by <a href="Mailto:youtalkedu@gmail.com">emailing me</a>.

		<h4><a id="4">Can I donate to you?</a></h4>
		<p>
			Of course, but I would suggest against it. The purpose of this site is to stimulate discussion
			about US education, so naturally your time and resources would be better spent on making 
			education better in this country.
		</p>
		<p>If, for whatever reason, you still feel inclined to donate, you may do so by clicking here {# DONATE #}.</p><br/>

	<h4><a id="5">I'm locked out of my account</a></h4>
	<p>
		Sorry! For security reasons, the number of logins you can attempt before being locked out of 
		your account is limited. 
		Please <a href="Mailto:youtalkedu@gmail.com">email me</a> and I will unlock your account.
	</p><br/>

	<h4><a id="6">My question is not listed</a></h4>
	<p>
		<a href="Mailto:youtalkedu@gmail.com">Email me</a> your question. 
		I will do my best to address it as quickly as I can.
	</p>
